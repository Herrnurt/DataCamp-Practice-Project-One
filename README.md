### Analyzing Tv Data

## Project Description
using  Intermediate Python skill, I did  analyze and extract meaningful insights from various sources. 
For this set of projects, I used a combination of data manipulation and visualization to explore television data.

In this project, looked at Super Bowl Data, generated insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows. 
I developed an informative plot that helps to visualize the viewership and quality of The Office throughout its nine seasons.
